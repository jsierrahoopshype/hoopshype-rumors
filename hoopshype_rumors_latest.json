While Jokić and Valančiūnas rarely play together (as I’ll get to in the Western Conference lineup breakdown next week),Doc Rivers has leaned into double-big play. Outside of a stretch of six games midway through the season-to-date, almost all of Giannis and Turner’s minutes have been played together. That strategy is working - the Bucks outscore their opponents by 9.4 points per 100 possessions with their two bigs on the court. The problem is, that’s mostly Giannis. The Bucks are still +4.9 when Giannis plays without Turner, but they are significantly negative whenever Giannis sits, regardless of what Turner is doing. So far, when Giannis misses games the Bucks are 1-6.Charting Hoops", "quote": "In my Copycat Candidates ranking, I had the Bucks near the top of the league in potential to go with a double-big lineup as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Myles Turner netted out as the second best big pairing, only behind Denver’s Nikola Jokić and Jonas Valančiūnas.
