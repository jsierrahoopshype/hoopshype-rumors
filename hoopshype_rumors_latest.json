They led 113-107 with 35 seconds remaining after seemingly staving off an initial 16-2 run. But Minnesota was granted one last life when Edwards drew a foul on a 3-point attempt, allowing him to cut the deficit in half and Chris Finch to play out the ensuing defensive possession without fouling.Denver Post", "quote": "Jokic’s 56 points matched the second-highest scoring total of his career.
