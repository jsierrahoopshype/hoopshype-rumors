So, leading into the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Brown set up a video call with Henare. He wanted to learn about the strategy referred to as “tagging up,” in which everyone crashes the offensive boards, though not recklessly. There are fundamentals behind tagging up, as Henare explained to Brown. When players crash, they aren’t golden retrievers playing fetch.Instead, they approach defenders at specific areas of the floor, meeting from behind, pinning those defenders into wherever they’re planted and blocking their pathways to leak out in transition or to retrieve long rebounds, which have grown more common with the popularity of the 3-pointer.
